# vptstools

Python tools to work with vertical profile time series.

## Installation

Python 3.9+ is required.

```
pip install vptstools
```

In case you also need the tools/services to run the data transfers (sftp, S3), make sure to install the additional dependencies to transfer files:

```
pip install vptstools[transfer]
```

Included modules/commands:

## CLI endpoints

### transfer_baltrad

CLI tool to move files from the Baltrad FTP server to an S3 bucket.

```
transfer_baltrad
```

The tool uses a configuration file `config.ini` containing the required configurations. An example is available in the `src/vptstools/bin` folder:

```
[baltrad_server]
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 3395
username = user
password = xxxxxxx
datadir = data

[destination_bucket]
name = aloft
```

### vph5_to_vpts

CLI tool to aggregate/convert a bunch of [ODIM hdf5 bird profiles](https://github.com/adokter/vol2bird/wiki/ODIM-bird-profile-format-specification) files (generated by [vol2bird](https://github.com/adokter/vol2bird)) to a single [vpts data package](https://github.com/enram/vpts-dp).

```
vph5_to_vpts --modified-days-ago=1
```

## Development instructions

See [contributing](docs/contributing.md) for a detailed overview and set of guidelines. If familiar with `tox`,
the setup of a development environment boils down to:

```
tox -e dev       # Create development environment with venv and register an ipykernel. Activate this environment to get started
source venv/bin/activate
```

Next, the following set of commands are available to support development:

```
tox              # Run the unit tests
tox -e docs      # Invoke sphinx-build to build the docs
tox -e format    # Run black code formatting

tox -e clean     # Remove old distribution files and temporary build artifacts (./build and ./dist)

tox -e linkcheck # Check for broken links in the documentation

tox -e publish   # Publish the package you have been developing to a package index server. By default, it uses testpypi. If you really want to publish your package to be publicly accessible in PyPI, use the `-- --repository pypi` option.
tox -av  # to list all the tasks available
```
